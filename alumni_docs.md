# Understanding Django's struct

[Struct ref ](https://medium.com/django-unleashed/django-project-structure-a-comprehensive-guide-4b2ddbf2b6b8)

- MVT : Model-Database View-interface and handles data processing? Template-static files?
- CORS: CORS is a mechanism to allow interaction with resources hosted on different domains. Let’s assume you have a web application that lives in domain.com. But, to save user information, the app calls an API hosted in another URL—for example, api.domain.com. So, when a request to save data is sent to api.domain.com, the server evaluates the requests based on its headers and the request’s source.

## creating dj project 
**Reason to choose DRF is coz we want to create api to interact with frontend**

[DRF setup guide](https://medium.com/@codexistslonglastingnotfog/django-rest-framework-a-step-by-step-guide-with-code-examples-efe9665b59d8)

1. create venv --> actiavte --> install dj, drf, cors-headers --> dj startproject --> app called core created
2. add the created app in the installed apps of *"setting.py"*
3. install mysqlclient -->

## Database
- For auto resizing of files, try imagemagick.
- Remember file name format
- store metadata for fast retrieval? but how?
- proper indexing to fetch it efficiently
- securi                    ty? huh


**db selection crisis duh!!!**

[ref site](https://akridata.ai/blog/store-images-in-database/)
1. BLOBS?
2. storing file paths in db (i.e) have separate storage besides db

1. postgres vs mysql : mysql is good since we need more read op than parallel writing or locks
    
choose blobs if no frequent access of image  

**db batch namings**
```
{
    "MSInt": 110,
    "MS": 120,
    "MSInt-Exit": 111,
    "MCA": 210,
    "MTechNIE": 310,
    "MTechNIS": 320,
    "MTechCSE": 330, 
}
```

- little problem with how int-exit should be added, maybe a new table? 
YES! a separate table for exits would be efficient, after adding stu in exit table , have to write a function to delete it from official table. solved. simply add them in the main table with diff batch id
- how to store mobile number? text or int? based on op the decision should be taken.
what are going to do with mobile? contact them? i think varchar is good coz we can write function to get numbers only or to our requirement.
- few have given personal mail id as inst mail and vice versa

**used sqlizer to convert excel sheets to sqlquery files**

## Functionalities 

1. verify the user - how? take creds and cross check with the main db
if not do manual cross checking. And add the new record
2. next step


## model datatype and fields in django
1. Many-to-one relationship i.e many students having same single batch and cant be in multiplr batches at once 
> fieldName= models.ForeignKey(primarykey_tablename, on_delete= models.PROTECT)
protect would not allow to delete the record, shows error
2. to create a model from existing db schema
> python manage.py inspectdb > filename.py
3. then do makemigrations and for migrate especially when already db exits the use to skip table already exists.
> python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
4. Unique constraint on multiple columns >>>later
 
## dj auth_user
**store password in a hash**
- PASSWORD_HASHERS: where thr first algo will be used to has the pass and to verify the password sees if the algo is in the list of algo if not raise valueerror
- three var: <algo><iteration><salt><hashedpass>
- password validation to help with poor pass choice from users 
> AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS

[password management](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/auth/passwords/)

**authentication system**
How to authenticate a user? by verifying the creds against mainalumni db 

```
verifyUser={
    verifyCreds:["full name"->char, regNo-->int, "courseName"-->char, 
    joinYear-->year or int, endYear-->year or int, "email"-->email, 
    country code, "mobile?"--> char]
    notrequiredField: [mobile]
    courseNames: ["MSInt": 110,
    "MS": 120,
    "MSInt-Exit": 111,
    "MCA": 210,
    "MTechNIE": 310,
    "MTechNIS": 320,
    "MTechCSE": 330,]

}
```
**Members are alumni and current PU students maybe faculties too**
```
if students then
    enter regNo, name, coursename, joinyear, instMail

```
then i'd have to maintain a current student db and alumni db separately

1. members status is needed like registered, profile info, mentor? 
2. write permissions for users
3. usertype table and all users type since one user can be in two roles like alumni and staffs, but do we need that in our case?

### To learn!!
1. wsgi and asgi(async http req)    
2. serializer  
3. models in django   
4. superuser?  
5. JWT , Djoser

### queries
1. students can also be verfied right? who the fuck are our user? alumni duh? but then who else?
2. mentor


### register

which is better? usercreation and later verify (or) verify and then usercreation 

```
    role --> Alumni, current students, staff/faculty
    email: [alumni:all,
            students: reg@pondiuni.ac.in,
            staff: name@pondiuni.ac.in]
    verify code

```
